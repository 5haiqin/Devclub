# Contributing to Devclub

Welcome! We love contributions from our community. Whether it's fixing a typo, adding a new event, or refactoring the codebase, your help is appreciated.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Devclub.git
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your specific feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
    ```

## Code Style

-   **HTML**: Use semantic tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) instead of generic `<div>` where possible.
-   **CSS**: Keep the `style.css` organized. Use comments to separate sections (e.g., `/* Navbar */`, `/* Hero Section */`).
-   **Indentation**: use 4 spaces for indentation.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

-   `feat:` A new feature
-   `fix:` A bug fix
-   `docs:` Documentation only changes
-   `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
-   `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

Example: `feat: add new gallery section for hackathon photos`

## Pull Requests

1.  Push your branch to GitHub.
2.  Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
